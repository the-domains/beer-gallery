# Forget thine apostrophe

> Familiar South Eastern Face.

![Bishops Finger, from the synonymous Shepherd Neame](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/18aa2293-eec7-4b9f-bdfd-76d83d8f5a68.jpg)

For a tender Sunday of recovery, an old familiar is your best friend.

A standard British beer supped over the channel and away from its standard pub decor. This classic undoubtedly reinforces British ale detractors arguments of the "warm fart in a glass".

But when you have the tongue trained on quality - like a compass pointing North - even a hint of the homesteads quality takes the edge off of a harsh Sunday smoothly.
