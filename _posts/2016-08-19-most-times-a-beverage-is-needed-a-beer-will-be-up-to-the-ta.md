There's gin. 

I'm no expert, but gin an' ice are better suited than beer and soggy cubes. 

Ale aught to be cellar cool. And beer is meant to make you more thirsty. How else will you make it to that 2nd pint?

Thanks gin. Mine will be a cold Hendrick's and tonic. Need the cucumber to bring out those flavours too.
