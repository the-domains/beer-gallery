# A frequently squandered hour
![](https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/3e534b8e0c0f261d9448e2d73f5758d2253ae4f2.jpg)

5 am comes but once a day.

### Most times folks are too busy sleeping to remember this hour.

Otherwise they're off doing other daily business.

But a powerful and punchy ale of flavourful combinations will soon remind you its that special time of the day.

Good job we've got Brewdog keeping us in check.
